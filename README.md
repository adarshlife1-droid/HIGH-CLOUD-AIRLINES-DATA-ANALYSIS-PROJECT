# HIGH CLOUD-AIRLINES-DATA -ANLYSIS-PROJECT
 The High CLoud Airlines Project is a comprehensive airline performance analysis designed to evaluate operational efficiency, revenue performance, flight trends, and customer travel patterns.
This project analyzes airline data to uncover insights related to flight performance, passenger load factor, route distribution, revenue generation, and delay patterns. The goal is to transform raw aviation data into actionable business intelligence that can support strategic decision-making.
# Project Objectives
Analyze overall airline performance
Track revenue trends over time
Measure Load Factor (Seat Utilization)
Identify high-performing routes
Evaluate delay patterns
Understand seasonal travel demand
Build KPI metrics for airline management
# Dataset description
The dataset includes the following key fields:
Flight Date
Flight Number
Source Airport
Destination Airport
Distance Group
Available Seats
Transported Passengers
Revenue
Load Factor
Aircraft Type
 The data is structured to support multi-level analysis including route-level, monthly, and yearly trends. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs were created to measure airline performance:
 Total Flights
 Total Passengers
Total Revenue
 Load Factor (%)
Top Routes by Revenue
Monthly Revenue Trend
Distance Group Analysis
 Top Performing Aircraft
 # Tools&Technologies used
Tableau / Power BI
SQL
Excel
 # Data Cleaning & Transformation
Removed null and duplicate records
Converted date fields to proper datetime format
Created calculated metrics such as:
Load Factor = (Transported Passengers / Available Seats) × 100
Revenue per Flight
Grouped distances into distance bands
Formatted revenue into millions for better readability
# Dashboard Features
The interactive dashboard includes:
Revenue Trend by Month
Load Factor Analysis
Revenue by Route
Distance Group Performance
Passenger Trend Over Time
Top 10 Flights by Revenue
The dashboard allows stakeholders to quickly monitor operational efficiency and identify performance improvement areas.
# Key Insights
High load factor routes contribute significantly to total revenue.
Certain months show seasonal demand spikes.
Medium-distance routes generate consistent revenue.
Aircraft utilization directly impacts profitability.
# Business Impact
This project demonstrates how airline data can be leveraged to:
Improve route planning
Optimize seat capacity
Increase revenue through better demand forecasting
Reduce operational inefficiencies
Support strategic airline expansion decisions
# Conclusion
The High Cloud Airlines project showcases the power of data analytics in the aviation industry. By transforming raw flight data into meaningful KPIs and visual insights, this project helps stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions
